            <p>Both of <span class="bio-name"></span> Shepard's parents were in the Alliance military. <span class="bio-pronoun-poss"></span> childhood was spent on ships and stations as they transferred from posting to posting.

            <p>One of <span class="bio-name"></span>'s first missions was an expedition to investigate Akuze, a lush world on the outskirts of Alliance space that had suddenly dropped out of contact. Arriving on the surface, <span class="bio-pronoun-poss"></span> patrol found the settlement intact, but there were no survivors.</p>

            <p>At nightfall, the thresher maws struck - mindless abominations of teeth and tentacles that rose from beneath the earth. Constant gunfire couldn't drown out the shrieks of <span class="bio-name"></span>'s fellow soldiers as they were dragged down to a gruesome death.</p>

            <p>Fifty marines died on Akuze. <span class="bio-name"></span> was the only one to make it back to the landing zone alive. A monument on the planet commemorates the massacre, a grim reminder of the price humanity must pay as they spread throughout the stars.</p>

            <p>After several years of service, <span class="bio-name"></span> joined the campaign to rid the Skyllian Verge of batarian slavers and other criminal elements. The final battle came when Alliance forces laid siege to Torfan, a slaver base built miles below the surface of a desolate moon. The superiority of the human fleet was wasted in the assault on the underground bunker, but <span class="bio-pronoun"></span> led a corps of elite ground troops into the heart of the enemy base.</p>

            <p>Nearly three-quarters of <span class="bio-name"></span>'s own squad perished in the vicious close-quarters fighting...a cost <span class="bio-pronoun"></span> were willing to pay to make sure not a single slaver made it out of Torfan alive.</p>
