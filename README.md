# Tribute Page
### Project requirements <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/build-a-tribute-page">here.</a>

Tribute Page for Free Code Camp - using mostly HTML and Bootstrap, and a little bit of CSS and jQuery.

I'm using Free Code Camp to help knock the rust off of my web development skills.

While the requirements asked for just a static web page, I decided that I wanted to make my tribute page more interactive and dynamic, as the multiple biographies would be more faithful to the lore of Mass Effect's Commander Shepard.
